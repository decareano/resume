This is my resume. The data is JSON, the template is Handlebars, the styling is CSS, and it's rendered into a PDF using PhantomJS.

The generated PDF is kept here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xlduz7ka5qj8hwd/resume.pdf

I wrote a blog post describing the process here: http://artur.ostrega.me/blog/how-to-build-your-resume-with-the-web/

## Usage
